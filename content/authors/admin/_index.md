My name is Kiarash Naghavi, and I am a Bachelor’s student in Aerospace Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. My bachelor’s thesis focuses on Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of a Nanorobot for Drug Delivery to Cancer Cells Based on Genetic Algorithm. I model functions then optimize the design parameters by the Genetic Algorithm. My goal is to expand my perspective about Multidisciplinary Design Optimization and machine learning that leads to these areas.
