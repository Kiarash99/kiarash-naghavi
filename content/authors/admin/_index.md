My name is Kiarash Naghavi Khanghah. I am currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering at the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. My bachelor’s thesis focuses on Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of a Nanorobot for Drug Delivery to Cancer Cells Based on Metaheuristic Algorithms. I derive objective functions then optimize the design parameters by the suitable Metaheuristic Algorithm. You can view further information about my bachelor’s project [here](https://kiarash-naghavi.netlify.app/project/multidisciplinary-design-optimization-of-a-nanorobot-for-drug-delivery-to-cancer-cells-based-on-genetic-algorithms/).

 I am also interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning and have taken introductory courses in reinforcement learning. I look forward to applying my knowledge of this area and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization in mechanical engineering applications. I am passionate about reading, meeting friends, and watching movies.
