My name is Kiarash Naghavi, and I am a Bachelor student in Aerospace Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. My bachelor’s thesis focuses on Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of a Nanorobot for Drug Delivery to Cancer Cells Based on Metaheuristic Algorithms. I derive objective functions then optimize the design parameters by the suitable Metaheuristic Algorithm. You can observe further information about my bachelor’s project [here](https://kiarash-naghavi.netlify.app/project/multidisciplinary-design-optimization-of-a-nanorobot-for-drug-delivery-to-cancer-cells-based-on-genetic-algorithms/). My goal is to expand my perspective about Multidisciplinary Design Optimization and machine learning that leads to these areas.
