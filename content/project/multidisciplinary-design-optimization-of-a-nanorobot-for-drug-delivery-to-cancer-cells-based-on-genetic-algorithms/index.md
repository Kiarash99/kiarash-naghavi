This project aims to design a nanorobot's structure to optimize hydrodynamics and propulsion objective functions like magnetic field and hydrodynamic force. Furthermore, it was a computational project. First, I compare different multidisciplinary metaheuristic algorithms and choose the best approach for this research, then derive our required equations and data from various papers about the magnetic field, hydrodynamic force, blood properties like velocity and pressure, and such wise. Then, by optimizing the nanorobot’s structure with a proper metaheuristic algorithm, I seek to minimize the objective function of the hydrodynamic force to lessen the drag force applied to the nanorobot. Additionally, for the minor biological damage to the patient and to maximize the speed of drug delivery to the cell, we considered minimizing the target functions of the magnetic field and time, respectively.

This project is under the supervision of [Associate Professor Ali Abedian](http://ae.sharif.edu/~portal/faculty/1921714931).
