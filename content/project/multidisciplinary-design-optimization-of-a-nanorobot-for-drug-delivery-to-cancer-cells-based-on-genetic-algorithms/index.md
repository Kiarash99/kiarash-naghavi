This research aims to optimize the multidisciplinary design of a nanorobot based on simulating their behavior to reach cancer cells. The disciplines considered in this problem include structure, hydrodynamics, propulsion, control, and guidance, considering four objective functions: the volume to surface ratio of nanorobots, hydrodynamic force, magnetic field, and time. In contrast, the maximum value of the volume-to-surface ratio will carry the maximized amount of drug to the cancer cells. We want to minimize the objective function of the hydrodynamic force to lessen the drag force applied to the nanorobot. Additionally, minimizing the target functions of the magnetic field and time will be considered for the minor biological damage to the patient and maximize the speed of drug delivery to the cell, respectively. We use one of the most popular meta-heuristic algorithms called the Genetic algorithm to optimize the design.

This project is a joint project with Ms.Saeide kazembeigi as her M.Sc project.
