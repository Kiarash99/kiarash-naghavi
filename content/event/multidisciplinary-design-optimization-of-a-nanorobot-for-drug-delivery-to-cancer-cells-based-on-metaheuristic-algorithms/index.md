title: Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of a Nanorobot for Drug Delivery to
  Cancer Cells Based on Metaheuristic Algorithms
abstract: This research aims to optimize the design of a nanorobot structure to
  optimize hydrodynamics, propulsion, control, and guidance’s objective
  functions like magnetic field and hydrodynamic force. First, we compare
  different multidisciplinary metaheuristic algorithms and choose the best
  approach for this research, then derive our required formulas and data from
  various papers about the magnetic field, hydrodynamic force, blood properties
  like velocity and pressure, and likewise. Then, by optimizing the nanorobot’s
  structure with a suitable metaheuristic algorithm, we want to minimize the
  objective function of the hydrodynamic force to lessen the drag force applied
  to the nanorobot. Additionally, for the minor biological damage to the patient
  and to maximize the speed of drug delivery to the cell, we considered
  minimizing the target functions of the magnetic field and time, respectively.
